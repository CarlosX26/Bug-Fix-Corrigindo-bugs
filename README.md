# Bug-Fix-Corrigindo-bugs

and this was a very interesting challenge, because here I received a code full of bugs,
and I had to go by parts seeing each piece of code and debugging I was correcting all the bugs, 
and here is the application is running normally, before it had problems with the states positioned 
in the wrong place, useEffect was causing an infinite loop, so I fixed that too, there were some problems 
in the return of each component because some were not returning the jsx correctly, and that was basically it.
